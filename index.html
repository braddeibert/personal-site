    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm originally from the Flathead County in Montana, where I grew up than
      30 minutes from Glacier National Park. I've lived in Montana for the
      majority of my life, but I've also done short stints in both Texas and
      California.
      <br />
      I enjoy activities like golfing, cycling and weight lifting in my free
      time. I'm a big sports fan, primarily of Packers football (gpg) but also
      of PGA tour golf, NBA basketball and any baseball at any level. I love all
      kinds of beer (definitely not equally), especially when enjoyed with
      others.
      <br />
      Today I live in Missoula, MT with the two most important women in my world
      - my beautiful wife Alicia & our helpless adopted cat Dorothy.
